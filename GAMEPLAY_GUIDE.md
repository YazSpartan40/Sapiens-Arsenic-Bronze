## Mining Iron Ore

Iron ore is your starting material. It spawns naturally throughout your world.

### Finding Iron Ore
Iron ore deposits spawn at moderate frequency. Search your terrain for distinctive iron ore.

**How to Mine:**
1. Assign a sapien to Mining
2. Mark iron ore deposits for collection
3. Ore automatically stores in **Iron Ore Storage**

---

## Smelting Iron Ingots

Convert raw ore into refined ingots at the kiln.

### Prerequisites
- Your civilization must have researched **Blacksmithing** (vanilla research)
- You need a kiln area and assignable sapien to blacksmithing role

### Iron Ingot Smelting
- **Recipe**: 3 Iron Ore → 3 Iron Ingots
- **Requirements**: Blacksmithing skill
- **Tools Needed**: Crucible
- **Location**: Kiln
- **Storage**: Ingots go to **Iron Ingot Storage**

**Note**: Each ore produces one ingot with no waste!

## Discovering the Iron Working Skill

The **Iron Working** skill must be discovered through investigation.

### How to Unlock the Iron Working Skill

1. **Prerequisites**: Your civilization must have researched **Blacksmithing**
   
2. **Trigger Discovery**: Have any sapien investigate an iron ingot
   - A sapien picks up a completed iron ingot
   - Open the investigation menu and select "Investigate"
   - This triggers the Iron Working skill discovery

3. **What Happens**: 
   - Once a sapien completes the investigation
   - The **Iron Working skill** becomes permanently available
   - All sapiens can now be assigned to Iron Working
   - All tool forging and assembly recipes unlock

**Iron Knife** - Cutting tool component (Trade: 25)
**Iron Chisel** - Precision tool component (Trade: 25)
**Iron Spearhead** - Combat weapon component (Trade: 30)
**Iron Hammerhead** - Heavy tool component (Trade: 30)
**Iron Pickaxehead** - Mining tool component (Trade: 30)

All tool heads use:
- Location: **Kiln**
- Tool: **Crucible**
- Skill: **Iron Working**
- Efficiency: 100% (1 ingot = 2 heads)
- Storage: **Iron Tool Storage**
